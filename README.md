# Getting Started with TypeScript

## Project Setup
- Initializing a project
- `tsconfig.json`

## Basics
- Types
- Variables
- Functions

## Advanced Concepts
- Interfaces
- Classes
- Modules
- Generics

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance
- Super()
- Polymorphism
- Access Modifiers
  - Public vs Private
  - Protected
  - Static
  - Readonly

## Tooling
- Linting
- Debugging

## Running TypeScript
 Compilation
- `npx tsc index.ts`
  This command compiles the TypeScript file index.ts into JavaScript. The output will be a JavaScript file (e.g., index.js), which you can then run with Node.js or include in a web project.
- `npx ts-node readonly.ts`
  This command compiles and runs the TypeScript file readonly.ts directly. It does not produce a separate JavaScript file; instead, it compiles the TypeScript code in memory and executes it immediately.  

## Asynchronous Programming
- Promises
- Async/Await
